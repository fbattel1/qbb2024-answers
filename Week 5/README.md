# QB Week 5 Exeercises


## Q1

### Q1.1

Per base sequence content and per sequence GC conent stand out as problematic, as well as the overrepresented sequences. 

Not matching the expected GC content distribution could be a result of contamination or could be biologically accurate. 

The base content being aberrant at the start of the sequence could represent contamination or it could be an artefact of the sequencing process. 

### Q1.2 

The origin of the most overrepresented sequence in this sample is Drosophila, which does make sense as this  is the species the sample was taken from.



## Q2

I would keep 15 samples.

Blocks of triplicates are clearly visible. This suggests high consistency between replicates. 



## Q3

### Q3.3

This doesn't look right, the data should be grouped by sample with each replicate a different shape, instead of every single replicate showing as its own sample. 


### Q3.6

Yes, the categories of enrichment do make sense because they are involved in digestion and metabolism, and these samples are from the Drosophila midgut.
