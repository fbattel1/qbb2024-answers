# QB Week 5 Exeercises


## Q1

### Q1.1

Per base sequence content and per sequence GC conent stand out as problematic, as well as the overrepresented sequences. 

Not matching the expected GC content distribution could be a result of contamination or could be biologically accurate. 

The base content being aberrant at the start of the sequence could represent contamination or it could be an artefact of the sequencing process. 

Corrections: The sequence is for actively expressed genes. GC-rich regions are a sign of active gene expression. The theoretical distribution is genome-wide and therefore considers both active (high GC) and inactive (low GC) regions. This is why the GC content of these sequences violates the genome-wide expectations. 

### Q1.2 

The origin of the most overrepresented sequence in this sample is Drosophila, which does make sense as this  is the species the sample was taken from.

Corrections: The most overrepresented sequence is a serine protease, which is associated with digestion. This is true for many of the other overrepresented sequences. This makes sense because the samples are from the Drosophila gut. 

## Q2

I would keep 15 samples.

Blocks of triplicates are clearly visible. This suggests high consistency between replicates. 

Corrections: 15 samples are what is left after rejecting samples with the percentage of unique reads less than 45%. This is why I would keep 15 samples.

There is some inconsistency between replicates as some sets of triplicates aren't as clearly defined as others. Ex. in the middle, one replicate is dark red and the otehrs aren't as dark. 


## Q3

### Q3.3

This doesn't look right, the data should be grouped by sample with each replicate a different shape, instead of every single replicate showing as its own sample. 


### Q3.6

Yes, the categories of enrichment do make sense because they are involved in digestion and metabolism, and these samples are from the Drosophila midgut.
