# QB Week 5 Exeercises


# Q1

#Q1.1
#Per base sequence content and per sequence GC conent stand out as problematic, as well as the overrepresented sequences. 
#Not matching the expected GC content distribution could be a result of contamination or could be biologically accurate. 
#The base content being aberrant at the start of the sequence could represent contamination or it could be an artefact of the sequencing process. 

#Q1.2 
#The origin of the most overrepresented sequence in this sample is Drosophila, which does make sense as this  is the species the sample was taken from.


# Q2

#I would keep 15 samples.
#Blocks of triplicates are clearly visible. This suggests high consistency between replicates.
