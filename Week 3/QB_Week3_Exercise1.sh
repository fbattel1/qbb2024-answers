# Working with Illumina short-read seq
# Study: lab strain of S. cervisciae crossed with wine strain to map associations between genotype and phenotype
# Diploid offspring sporulated, colony from haploid spore sequenced 
# Data: yeast sergegants, or haploid genomes that should be mosaic of OG strains
# Mosaic = having long tracks of ancestry from one strain instead of another 

# Load seq data into library and unzip 

# Exercise 1
# Quality control. Only argument it takes is fastq. Produces HTML as output
# Open HTML in finder and will open webpage
