QB Lab Week 1 Exercise 

Q1.1 

1Mbp genome x 3 = 3 Mbp = 3,000,000 bp
3,000,000 bp / 100 bp = 30,000 reads 

30,000 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage. 


Q1.4

1. 49535 base pairs had 0 coverage. 
2. This largely matches the poisson expectations but could be better. The normal distribution fits the data but also could be better. 

Q1.5
1. 80 base pairs had 0 coverage.
2. This matches the poisson expectations well, better than the 3x coverage plot. The same can be said for the normal distribution. 

Q1.6
1. 12 base pairs had 0 coverage. 
2. This matches the poisson expectations very well. The poisson distribution and the normal distribution match the best of all 3 coverages we simulated.

Q2.6
 To accurately reconstruct the sequence of the genome it would take sequencing of longer reads.
