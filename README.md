I'm having fun today. 

QB Lab Week 1 Exercise 

Step 1.1 

1Mbp genome x 3 = 3 Mbp = 3,000,000 bp
3,000,000 bp / 100 bp = 30,000 reads 

30,000 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage. 


Step 1.4

1. Approximately 50,000 base pairs had 0 coverage. 
2. This closely matches the poisson estimates. The normal distribution fits the data poorly.
