# QB Week 10 Exercise 3

## Exercise 3.1
Each of these values correspond to the average fluorescence intensity in each channel for the labeled nucleus.
For nascentRNA channel, it's labeling nuclei where there are nascent RNA, indicating active transcription.
For PCNA channel, it's labeling where DNA is actively replicating. 
For the ratio, it is a ratio transcription to replication. 


## Exercise 3.2
In  my figure, POLR2B has highest ratio and PIM2 has lowest. 

POLR2B with the highest ratio means that there is more transcription than DNA replication.
This doesn't make much sense since POLR2B is an RNA polymerase and is theoretically knocked out here.
One would expect nascentRNA levels to be lower. Perhaps there is a compensatory mechanism for transcription at play.

PIM2 with the lowest ratio means that there is more DNA replication. 
This doesn't make much sense eitehr since PIM2 is invovled in the cell cycle, you would expect that knocking it out would result in less DNA replication.
