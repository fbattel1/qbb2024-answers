Q 2.3

1. Negative, or purifying selection refers to the removal of harmful mutations from a given population. Exons appear to be under the highest purifying selection because their enrichment decreases as the MAF increases. That is, their enrichment in a population becomes less common as the allele becomes more common. Furthermore, the log2 enrichment values of exons also begin and remain significantly lower than the other features on the plot as MAF increases. This demonstrates that regardless of MAF, the enrichment value of exons is lower. 


2. This is likley due to the alleles not being common in large populations. 

3. Yes, one would expect regulatory elements, introns, and 'other' to not change much due to selective pressure. Meanwhile, exons, which code for genes and have phenotypes, are more likely to undergo selective pressure. This is because genetic changes that confer a fitness advantage are more likely to be maintained in a population. Parts of the genome that are expressed, i.e., exons, are subject to such pressure.
