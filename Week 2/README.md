Q 2.3

1. Exons appear to be under the highest purifying selection because the enrichment decreases as the MAF increases.

2. This is likley due to the alleles not being common in large populations. 

3. Yes, one would expect regulatory elements, introns, and 'other' to not change much due to selective pressure. Meanwhile, exons, which code for genes and have phenotypes, are more likely to undergo selective pressure.
